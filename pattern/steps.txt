Step 1:  What is the first value?
        if same: Then put that value.
        if different then put j = i;

Step 2:  Check if the values are increasing or decreasing
        if increasing then put the condition <= and ++
        if decreasing then put the condition >= and --

Step 3: Check the last value in each row
        if same then put that value in j<= that last number
        if different then j<=i

Step 4: Write the condition of i 
        if increasing then (i=i; i<=5; i++)
        if decreasing then (i=5; i>=1; i--)

Note: First 3 steps are for the condition of j (i.e. inside loop)
      and Step 4 is for i (i.e. outer loop)
